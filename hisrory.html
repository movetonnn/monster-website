     <div class="item item2">The parent company that originally created Monster Energy Drinks was Hansen's Natural, whose mission was so far from that of the energy drink it's a real head-scratcher how Monster came to be. According to Fortune, Hansen's was first founded in the 1930s as a family run business that actually started off by making fruit juices. Hansen's claimed that their drinks only used natural ingredients and were good for you. Though the company did experiment with sodas in the 1970s, they still stuck by their original plan to create natural products.</div>

    <div class="item item3">Things definitely took an unexpected turn when they decided to experiment with Monster Energy Drinks, launching the line in 2002. One of the primary reasons was to gain more popularity and brand recognition as the energy drink market started to really take off. Turns out it was a great idea â€” Monster was extremely popular when it was first launched and the company's profits soared beyond their expectations upwards of $1.7 billion annually.</div>

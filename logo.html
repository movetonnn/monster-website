        <div class="text text1">The brand’s emblem was presented immediately in the year of its foundation and has never changed: now it looks the same as in 2002. A professional design studio developed the modernist style logo. She came up with a big neon green “M” (a reference to the Monster name) set against a black background.</div>

      <div class="container2">
        <div class="box text2">The letter is stylized as a claw mark from a wild monster that bursts out of a can with an energy drink. Therefore, the three stripes look like scratches left by those who sit inside. Due to its unique and unusual logo, the company was even sued for using satanic symbols.</div>
        <div class="box text3">Others compare the Monster Energy logo to the Hebrew kabbalistic signs that have the numerological meaning of six. In their opinion, the drink’s emblem is a biblical mark of the number of the beast. But the branding agency that offered this option for the power engineer proved that her work had nothing to do with Satanic symbols and that it was just an artistic allegory of “punctures” on the wall of the can.</div>
